# DevOps Mini Project

## Overview
This repository is part of my Cloud & DevOps lab practice for 2025.  
It contains infrastructure code, documentation, and supporting material to practice real-world DevOps workflows.

## Goals
- Use **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Practice **Git & GitHub workflows** (branching, PRs, approvals)
- Document operations with **runbooks**
- Track decisions using a **decision log**

## Repo Structure
- `docs/operations-guide/` → Runbooks, SOPs, and how-to guides
- `docs/decision-log/` → Architecture & decision records
- `infra/` → Terraform infrastructure (to be added later)
- `app/` → Application code or scripts (to be added later)

## Contribution Workflow
- All work is done on feature branches
- Create Pull Requests into `main`
- **2 approvals required** before merge (branch protection enabled)
